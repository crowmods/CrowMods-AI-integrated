# Phase 181 — Secret Reference Management

## Objective
Reference secrets by stable identifiers without embedding secret values in application source.

## Included
- Fail-closed backend control
- API boundary
- PostgreSQL audit schema
- Regression tests
- Smoke test
- Integration documentation

## Security
Do not place secret values, private keys, access tokens, or credentials in
request bodies, logs, source control, or audit records. Production deployment
must use the central authentication and authorization layer.

## Acceptance
Required actor context is enforced, unsafe object input is rejected, and
security-sensitive operations have an auditable boundary.

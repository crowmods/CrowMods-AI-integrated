# Phase 211 — Asset Discovery

## Objective
Register discovered assets with source and timestamp metadata.

## Included
- Backend control module
- API boundary
- PostgreSQL audit schema
- Regression tests
- Smoke test
- Integration documentation

## Security
Production deployments must put this boundary behind central authentication
and authorization. Do not store credentials, private keys, or secrets in
source code, request payloads, or audit records.

## Acceptance
Valid controlled context is accepted, required actor context is enforced,
and disabled or invalid operations fail safely.
